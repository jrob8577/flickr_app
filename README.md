This won't currently win any design awards. Should probably add bootstrap. Need
to tweak the scrolling check to create a smoother scroll, probably with some preload.
Haven't gotten around to autocomplete yet, will probably just throw in lookahead
or some decent library. Could optimize Handlebars template compilation.

Current external dependencies: lodash.js, handlebars.js

#### API Requests to Flickr
See the lib directory

#### Load pictures in a continuous scroll
See the app/javascripts/flickr directory

### Part 2

#### Tap image brings up larger image with details

### Part 3

#### Add details to grid view
Wasn't sure what this meant :shrug:

### Part 4

#### Add a search bar and run a search for images
See the app/javascripts flickr directory

Currently implemented to search by tag, but switching out to text search is easy enough
